This is a webpage that is not only impressive, but absolutely resplendent as well. When I gaze upon this pile of pixels I think, "Wow, humanity has come a long way". See for yourself and you shall reach the next plane of existence, because you can even check the state

absolute pleasure to create such a majestic piece of technology to further the human race.
